    machine states are defined by states property. each state is a dict that can contain following values:
        final: bool >> defined if this state is final state
        event: str >> show which method should be called if machine is in that state
        transitions: dict >> each key shows an action str or method name which if input action equals to or the method
            called by the action returns True, that transition will be accepted. each transition value is a dict with
            these values:
                state: str >> show the next state to set
                event: str >> method name to be called after transition
        else: str >> a method name that if none of transitions be accepted, will be called.
